				<h3>Hiking</h3>
				<img class="smallPhoto" src = "photos\hike.jpg"/>
				<p>I grew up very close to nature and the outdoors, and any chance that I get I try to get back out into the bush. I 
				first started hiking and backpacking in my early teens, and often make weekend trips when possible.</p>

				<h3>Team sports</h3>
