# Archived Project

This was my very first experience with HTML, CSS, and Web technologies in general. 
This project was started in 2018, and largely based off a HTML book I bought. 
While I am proud of what I accomplished with knowing so little, 
I wrote this project before I understood how to read documentation, or how to use the dev tools in chrome, 
or what an IDE was (most of this was written in notepad++). 

As such, it would take me more effort than it is worth to update this project to a state I am proud of. 
However, I can't stand to delete the repo.  
  
I leave it here as a testament to how far I have come.
