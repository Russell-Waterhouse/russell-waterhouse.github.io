		<h3>Beaver Valley Feeds Website</h3>
		<p>I am the sole designer and builder of <a href = "https://www.beavervalleyfeeds.com">beavervalleyfeeds.com</a>,
		which attracts a new demographic of customers to my former employer. This website was built with the 
		help of wix.com, and is my first website.</p>

<!-- website section -->
		<h3>This website</h3>
		<p>This website has been designed and built from scratch with my knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3, and is my second website. This is the first Version of the website,
		last updated on September 30, 2018. Further updates are already in progress. While the current version does not use any javascript or plug-ins, they will be 
		incorporated into future versions. It will be updated as I complete more projects, learn more skills, and have new design ideas for the website.

		<h3>Robot Project 2018</h3>
		<img id = "smallPhoto" src = "C:\Users\Owner\Documents\University\ENGR120\robot slant view.jpg"/>		
		<p>In one of my classes, a team of three was required to build a working model for an autonomous 
		undersea cable-laying robot (shown on the right). The objective was for the robot to take a cable from a spool and take it to a beacon, where it had to be 
		attached. In my group, I was the team leader and main programmer. This gave me plenty of experience in programming microcontrollers. 
		The entire project used <a href = "https://www.vexrobotics.com/276-2194.html">VEX microcontrollers,</a> and was coded in a variant of C, which is were I learned to
		write complex programs in C. Our project did so well that we received an A for the project and were invited to the Uvic Robotics competition, which we did 
		compete in. The whole project was designed and developed from January to March 2018. This project inspired me to start a robot project of my own, which 
		I am currently working on with a colleague. I look forward to the future experience that I hope to gain in this field.

		<h3>Degree Planning App</h3>
		<p>To gain experience in Java and in mobile app development, I am working with a colleague to build an
		app that helps you plan out your degree. It will have features that enable yearly class planning, GPA 
		calculating, and semester planning with ease. It is currently under development. No version is currently available to the public, but below are 
		some concept sketches of what the finished product will look like.

<!--beverage fetching robot section-->
		<h3>Beverage fetching robot</h3>
		<p>To work more with robotics, embedded systems, microprocessors and microcontrollers, I am designing, programming, and building an autonomous arduino-based robot.
		The first iteration is planned to be a line following robot which will bring cold drinks from a despensor to the user. It was inspired by my grandfather, who 
		due to his age, is less and less willing to get up from his chair and get his nightly cola.
