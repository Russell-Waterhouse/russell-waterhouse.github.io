            <h3>Hack the Code Brain Teaser Game</h3>
            <p>I built this little game in the spring of 2020, and it is availabe for download 
            <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.russell_waterhouse.hackthecode">here.</a>
            The goal of the game is to guess the phrase that has been scrambled by an encoding algorithm. Each wrong guess shows you how it would have been scrambled using the 
            same algoritm.
            
            <br/><br/>I wrote the app in <i>Kotlin</i>, and used more advanced techniques and design patterns, such as dependency injection using the <i>Dagger Library</i> 
            to make testing UI components easier. 
            
            <br/><br/>During this project, I also experimented with various software development techniques, such as <i>Test Driven Development (TDD)</i>. While I did this primarily to  
            expose me to new ways of looking at software development methods, I also think that it produced a more robust and stable end result.
            
            <br/><br/>Lastly, this project gave me a chance to implement some of the code readability and design patterns that I've been reading about in books 
            like <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a> or 
            <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Brain-Friendly/dp/0596007124/ref=sr_1_1?crid=5O349WOZTWA2&dchild=1&keywords=head+first+design+patterns&qid=1598730657&s=books&sprefix=head+first%2Cstripbooks%2C211&sr=1-1">

            <h3>Degree Planning App</h3>
            <p>Planning what courses to take and when to take them is a headache 
            that every student knows, and this is a tool to help alleviate some of that pain!
            <br/>It is currently available on the app store 
            <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.russell_waterhouse.degreeplanner">here</a>.
            
            The current version supports basic course planning, and inevitably I use it a few times every semester. When someone asks me when I am taking a course, I have the answer in 
            the palm of my hand! If I receive an offer for a co-op extension, I can move things around and see if it sets me behind my studies in 5 minutes, 
            and that's a job that used to take 3 hours! Of all the projects that I have worked on, this one has probably saved me the most time. 
            
            <br/><br/>This app was written in <i>Java,</i> and makes use of many of the new (or, new at the time) android architecture components, 
            such as the new Room Persistence Library and ViewModel class.

            <h3>Net Present Value Calculator</h3>
            <p>In my Economics class, we learned how to compare the net value of projects. There are formulas to use when trying to decide
            whether to put month into a project that will pay $1000 tomorrow, or $100 a year for 10 years. I found these formulas so useful, 
            that I made a command line app that does those calculations for you. 
            <br/><br/>As a result of this project, I have a useful tool to use whenever I need to make
            such calculations, which will save me both time and money when making financial decisions.
            <br/><br/>This project was coded in <i>Python</i> for ease of readability.
