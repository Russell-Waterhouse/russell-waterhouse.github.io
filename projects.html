		<h3>Robot Project 2018</h3>
		<p>In one of my classes, A team of three was required to build a working model for an autonomous 
		undersea cable-laying robot. In my group, I was the team leader and main programmer. This gave
		me a lot of experience in programming microcontrollers and I look forward to the future experience
		that I hope to gain in this field.

		<h3>Beaver Valley Feeds Website</h3>
		<p>I am the sole designer and builder of <a href = "https://www.beavervalleyfeeds.com">beavervalleyfeeds.com</a>,
		which attracts a new demographic of customers to my former employer. This website was built with the 
		help of wix.com, and is my first website.

<!-- website section -->
		<h3>This website</h3>
		<p>This website has been designed and built from scratch with my knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3, and is my second website. It will be 
		updated as I complete more projects, learn more skills, and have new design ideas for the website.

		<h3>Degree Planning App</h3>
		<p>To gain experience in Java and in mobile app development, I am working with a colleague to build an
		app that helps you plan out your degree. It will have features that enable yearly class planning, GPA 
		calculating, and semester planning with ease. It is currently under development.

<!--beverage fetching robot section-->
		<h3>Beverage fetching robot</h3>
		<p>To work more with robotics and microcontrollers, I would like to do some arduino-based projects.
		The first of which is a line following robot which can fetch beverages, such as a can of coke,
		and bring them to me. I plan it to be a gift for my grandfather, who would enjoy the hell out of it.
		The designs for it are presented below:
