			<h3>Beaver Valley Feeds Website</h3>
			<img class = "smallPhoto" src = "photos\beavervalley.jpg" />					
			<p>I am the sole designer and builder of <a href = "https://www.beavervalleyfeeds.com">beavervalleyfeeds.com</a>,
			which attracts a new demographic of customers to my former employer. This website was built with the 
			help of wix.com, and is my first website. The website was designed solely with the customer in mind, as both new customers and 
			those that hae been clients for years had to be thought of, hence the simple, informative design with an emphasis on easy-to-use
			navigation and eye catching photography. Feel free to follow the link above and browse around my work!</p>

			<h3>Degree Planning App</h3>
			<p>To gain experience in Java and in mobile app development, I have completed an app that helps students plan their degree. It is currently available on the app store 
			<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.russell_waterhouse.degreeplanner">here</a>. Planning what courses to take and when to take them is a headache 
			that every student knows, and this is a tool to help alleviate some of that pain! The current version only supports the most basic class planning, but you can be certain
			that I am working on an update to offer the best product possible to my peers. It will have features that enable yearly class planning, GPA 
			calculating, and semester planning with ease. The current version uses java as the source language (for more about my escapades with Kotlin, see the current projects 
			section below). I have implemented many of the new android architecture components, such as the new Room Persistence Library and ViewModel class.

			<h3>This website</h3>
			<img class="smallPhoto" src = "photos/webDesign.PNG"/>
			<p>This website has been designed and built from scratch with my knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3, and is my second website. This is the first Version of the website,
			last updated on June 28, 2019. Further updates are already in progress. While the current version does not use any javascript or plug-ins, they will be 
			incorporated into future versions. It will be updated as I complete more projects, learn more skills, and have new design ideas for the website.

			<h3>Robot Project 2018</h3>
			<img class = "smallPhoto" src = "photos/robot slant view.jpg"/>		
			<p>In ENGR120, a team of three was required to build a working model for an autonomous 
			undersea cable-laying robot (shown above). The objective was for the robot to take a cable from a spool and take it to a beacon, where it had to be 
			attached. In my group, I was the team leader and main programmer. The entire project used 
			<a href = "https://www.vexrobotics.com/276-2194.html">VEX microcontrollers,</a> and was coded in a variant of C. Our project did so well that we received 
			an A for the project and were invited to the Uvic Robotics competition, which we did compete in. The whole project was designed and developed from January 
			to March 2018. This project inspired me to start a robot project of my own, which I am currently working on with a colleague. I look forward to the future 
			experience that I hope to gain in this field.

		<h3>To-Do list app</h3>
		<p>To work more with Kotlin, concurrency and UI Design,  I am designing and programming a to-do list app. Right now (September 19, 2010), I have the model completed 
		(implemented with the <a href = "https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room">Room Persistence Library</a>). I am currently working on testing this. 
		After I have tested and refactored the code for the model, I will do up the UI With a simple RecyclerView, and then work on making it visually stunning. My last 
		app lacked any UI Design time, and this project is to be different. 
		<br/>So far, I haven't written a single line of java code for the project, it has all been in Kotlin. By the end of this project, I hope to be proficient with programming
		in Kotlin.
		<br/>I know that this isn't a project that really shows off my creativity, but I believe in learning to walk before learning to run. I have several ideas for 
		projects to work on that I want to do in Kotlin, but I need to learn the basics with the language first.
