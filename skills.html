		<h2>Computer-related skills</h2>
		<h3>Languages</h3>
		<hr/><hr/>
		<h4>Programming fundamentals in C</h4>
		<h4>Experiences:</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>CSC 111: Programming Fundamentals I: In this class I created numerous programs which dealt with topics such as </li>
		<ul>
			<li>File I/O</li>
			<li>Storage Allocation</li>
			<li>Functional Programming best practices</li>
			<li>Incremental testing and development</li>
		</ul>	
		<li>Robot Project in ENGR120: In this course I was the team leader and main programmer. The microcontroller was a VEX model and programmed in a 
		variant of C called robotC, which is basically C but with some extra libraries for using the digital and analog ports. </li>
		</ul>
		<hr/>

		<h4>Programming fundamentals in Java</h4>
		<h4>Experiences:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>App Project: This Project is currently in the building stage, and more detail can be found on the "Projects" page. 
			In this project I am developing skills in mobile app development including
			<ul>
				<li>GUI development</li>
				<li>Storage and File I/O</li>
				<li>Exception handling</li>				
				<li>Best programming practices</li>
			</ul>	
			<li>CSC115: Programming Fundamentals II: in this class I built programs that used programming tools such as 
			<ul>
				<li>Best practices for systematic development, maintenance, and documentation of software systems</li>
				<li>Classes, objects and interfaces</li>
				<li>Control and data abstraction</li>
				<li>Recursion</li>

		<h3>Techniques</h3>
		<hr/><hr/>
	
		<h4>Debugging Programs</h4>
		<h4>Experiences:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>App Project</li>
			<li>Robot Project in ENGR120: Design and Communication: As the main programmer of the robot, I was responsibble for both writing code that is 
			easily debugged, and then debugging it</li>
			<li>CSC111: Programming Fundamentals I: It was my job to debug both my own code and to debug functions from programs which I did not write in 
			assignments and on tests</li>
			<li>CSC115: Programming Fundamentals II: It was my task to debug my own programs in this course</li>
