           <h3>VikeLabs Club-Spontaniius Project</h3>
           <h3>Club Developer</h3>
           <p>VikeLabs is a software Development club based at UVIC. The club is comprised of teams of 3-8, each team working on one project. 
           I am a part of the Spontaniius Project, developing a new social networking app.
           <br/><br/>What I have been working on has been an activity for the user to create events for people to meet at. It's full of network requests and 
           cacheing data locally and UI design, and I'm having a lot of fun with the project so far! Unfortunately, COVID-19 has set our development team 
           back a bit, and at this moment there is no final product for me to show off. </p>
